## System Architecture

### Core Components

  - **Core Constants**: All UBP mathematical constants are operational.
  - **Enhanced Bitfield v3.1**: Features backward compatibility with v2.0/v3.0.
  - **HexDictionary**: Provides universal data storage.
  - **Toggle Algebra**: Contains 22 operations with integrated analytics.
  - **GLR Framework**: The advanced error correction system is active.
  - **RGDL Engine**: The resonance geometry system is fully operational.

### Systems

  - **Enhanced CRV System**: Provides adaptive resonance selection.
  - **HTR Engine**: The harmonic toggle resonance system is active.
  - **BitTime Mechanics**: Enables temporal coordination.
  - **Rune Protocol**: Manages high-level control functions.
  - **Enhanced Error Correction**: Contains advanced data recovery systems.
  - **Nuclear Realm**: Utilizes an E8 lattice with Zitterbewegung.
  - **Optical Realm**: Integrates photonic crystal systems.
  - **Realm Management**: All seven realms are fully operational.

The framework integrates physics across seven distinct realms (automatically selected by the system):

  - **Electromagnetic Realm**: Uses Cubic GLR at 635 nm resonance.
  - **Quantum Realm**: Employs Tetrahedral GLR at 655 nm with Zitterbewegung.
  - **Gravitational Realm**: Uses FCC GLR at 1000 nm.
  - **Biological Realm**: Based on H4 120-Cell GLR at 700 nm.
  - **Cosmological Realm**: Uses H3 Icosahedral GLR at 800 nm.
  - **Nuclear Realm**: Utilizes E8-to-G2 symmetry from $10^{16}$ to $10^{20}$ Hz.
  - **Optical Realm**: Incorporates a photonic crystal at 600 nm.
